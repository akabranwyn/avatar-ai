## AI and Sex Robots Won't Save MGTOW

### MGTOW's best-case arrangement with "females"

The manosphere seems to think that if they're able to hold out long enough their dream vision of a perfect partner can become a reality - A female presence who:
- isn't interested in resource extraction
- can fit whatever definition of beauty and engagement they see fit
- and can have sex without any conflicting emotional reciprocation

So any relationship in this context is decidedly one-sided. In fact this aligns with what a lot of the manosphere, MGTOW included, have advocated for. *geomaxxing, something else here*

In general MGTOW's attitude towards relationships is that you will always need to be guarded and ready to "go your own way" as soon as something is not favorable towards you in this arrangement. It is the prevention of any anchors and attachments that may force a male to sacrifice in order to maintain the advantages they may get from the arrangement. Deep emotional bonds are a weakness that can lead to manipulation or an uneven power structure unfavorable to the men.

A robotic companion in this sense fits a perfect bill; of course, this is because "robot" (from greek? slave) is a purely tunable and programmable entity that can exceed at a form of mimicry and an analog for love that the MGTOW followers idealize.

But apart from the absurdity and sadness of a life with only a shallow emotional connection, what about the practicality? 

### The rise of LLM

In the past year alone we've seen the explosion of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT (based on GPT-3) onto the scene, creating huge impact as well as headlines.

With the arrival of GPT-4 just under year later, the promise of true conversational AI is just around the corner, right? *nuclear fusion a decade away*

Consider this though; any large language model (in this case, an inference model) is simply a set of connected layers providing a mathematical (and probabilistic) pathway from one dissected input such as text, images, or speech to an appropriately formatted response. Now the way this model is generated takes into account a wide range of data. This can be targetted to specific situations of course, but the most appealing form is to be able to be as generic as possible, and able to respond to the widest array of possible input prompts. This is what you'd want in your partner, right? The same formulaic responses would just be boring.

### About GPT-4

- GPT-4 is successful in these situations
- GPT-4 also suffers from hallucinations

### The Linear Projection fallacy

Now let's switch gears, what's a reasonable timeline that people are willing to wait for this sort of objectified and possibly formulaic relationship? 3 years? 5? 10?

The linear projection fallacy is: 

* Define linear projection fallacy * 
The error of presuming that future change will be a simple and steady extension of past trends â€“ i.e., most disciplines envisioning futures with only minor changes as compared to the present moment.

Practically speaking, technology advances what seems like years in a day, and what seems like a day in years. Before GPT-3, development began ((research))

### What are you Really Waiting for?

What does a normal product development cycle look like? Let's say we start today from the best tech, rather, the best sex robot tech. 

(realdolls?)

Now, add in some capability to interact, even a year from now let's call it GPT-5; What are we looking at? 

*Synthesized voice from chatgpt output, static doll*

Is this really appealing as a companion - even just for sex? Let's move forward another year - we refine the features, add some incredible advancements in robotics, we get some ... convincing facial movement and upgrade to GPT-6! This time with realistic pillow talk AND moaning in 30 different languages. Formulaic responses sure, but at least this has a learning capability for training to a much more personalized response set based on previous conversations. She remembers you had that project due and wishes she could actually rub your shoulders.

No? Still not appealing? 5 years - incredible boston robotics level of articulation has reached the consumer! GPT-8 is completely conversational. Althouth optimistic, the holy grail of companionship is here! 

After 5 years, the most basic level of companionship (not just sex of course) is available for... top price.

Was it really worth the wait? Is a 5 year opportunity cost, 5 years of actual happiness, worth an optimistic perfect companion?
